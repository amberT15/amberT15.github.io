## Abstract:

Data augmentations can greatly enhance the generalization of deep neural networks (DNNs). However, there are limited strategies available in regulatory genomics because modifying DNA can alter its function in unknown ways. Here we introduce a suite of evolution-inspired augmentations and circumvent issues of unknown function through a fine-tuning procedure using the original, unperturbed data. We demonstrate this approach improves generalization and model interpretability across several established DNNs in regulatory genomics.
