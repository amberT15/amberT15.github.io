## Abstract:

Deep neural networks (DNNs) hold promise for functional genomics prediction, but their generalization capability may be limited by the amount of available data. To address this, we propose EvoAug, a suite of evolution-inspired augmentations that enhance the training of genomic DNNs by increasing genetic variation. Random transformation of DNA sequences can potentially alter their function in unknown ways, so we employ a fine-tuning procedure using the original non-transformed data to preserve functional integrity. Our results demonstrate that EvoAug substantially improves the generalization and interpretability of established DNNs across prominent regulatory genomics prediction tasks, offering a robust solution for genomic DNNs.
