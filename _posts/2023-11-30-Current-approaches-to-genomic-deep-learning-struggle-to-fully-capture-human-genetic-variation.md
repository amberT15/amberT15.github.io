## Abstract:
Deep learning shows promise for predicting gene expression levels from DNA sequences. However, recent studies show that current state-of-the-art models struggle to accurately characterize expression variation from personal genomes, limiting their usefulness in personalized medicine.We demonstrate the efficacy of this approach across various DNNs quantitatively with synthetic data and qualitatively with chromatin accessibility data.
